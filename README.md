# Portfolio Website for Liam Wolfe Rose
Static HTML/CSS website to showcase previous design work, project summaries, and front-end styling. 

## Project Objective
The objectives of this website are three-fold: 
I) express my personal voice and style as a designer,
II) document my "product" creation process from early-stage wireframing to published codebase,
and III) provide a public nexus for my professional profiles, social media, portfolio, and links.

## About this Website
Simplicity and accessibility were the guiding priorities for choosing a static HTML/CSS website. As my first ever "full-stack" solo project, I wanted to achieve a thoughtful balance of displaying my personal aesthetic preferences with implemeting a website that offers a pleasant, easily traversable UX for all users regardless of ability, bandwith, or circumstances. At times this presented tradeoffs and lead to the use of workarounds to enable interactive features without the use of scripting languages, and in these cases every recommended a11y accommodation was applied.

Every line of code in this repository was written by hand or found via traditional search methods. While I am normally an avid user of AI tools and assistive technologies for product-related tasks, for this project I wanted to be able to discuss every possible decision, whether architectural choice or ornamental detail. This website was built using the following tools and libraries: 
- [Figma](https://www.figma.com/) (wireframing & prototyping) 
- [Stark](https://www.getstark.co/) (accessibility monitoring & suggestions)
- [IONOS](https://www.ionos.com/) (hosting & deployment)
- [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/) (social media & link icons)

Another anomaly to be disclosed is that this was not designed and built via linear waterfall process or agile iteration. I chose to enjoy this rare opportunity to create a website from the outside in, converging to a specific asymptotic outcome from my dual functions as designer and developer like a butterfly's wings to its body. Despite this self-indulgence, I have sought to rigorously comment my code and explain any code/syntax that is potentially obscure to other examiners. 

This website is hosted via carbon-neutral data centers and designed to minimize unnecessary electricity usage (ie no Google Ads).
